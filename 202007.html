			I just finished reading Stephen Pinker's most recent book, <i>Enlightenment Now</i>. It contains a bunch of useful ideas, and one of those ideas that I think deserves to be more widely known is the difference between <em>complacent optimism</em> and <em>conditional optimism</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Complacent optimism</em> is the belief that things will get better without us having to do anything about it - in Pinker's description, "the feeling of a child waiting for presents on Christmas morning." It is the belief that a good thing will come to us, whether or not we act to make it come about.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Conditional optimism</em>, on the other hand, is the belief that things can get better, but only if we work to make them better. Pinker describes it as "the feeling of a child who wants a treehouse and realizes that if he gets some wood and nails and persuades other kids to help him, he can build one."
		</p>
		<p>
			In <i>Enlightenment Now</i>, Pinker argues that when we look at the big picture, we can see that measures of quality of life and wellbeing have been increasing - clearly, there is some cause for optimism. Furthermore, the main reason for these improvements is the application of reason. There will always be problems - the Second Law of Thermodynamics guarantees this - but people can apply reason to solve these problems, and with each problem solved, the world becomes a little better.
		</p>
		<p>
			When is each kind of optimism, complacent and conditional, justified? As far as I can figure, both have their place. The historical record shows us that humans have been effective at solving problems, and there's little reason to assume we'll stop any time soon - a cause for complacent optimism. But only when someone confronts and grapples with any particular problem can it be solved. Even though we cannot address every problem we come across, if each of us exercises and acts upon conditional optimism towards a few of those things we'd like to see improved - be them in our own lives, our communities, or in the world at large - we can take comfort in the fact that many people are working with us to solve these problems. <!-- there was a better, more optimistic conclusion... -->
