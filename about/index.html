        <p><strong>My name is Jacob deGroot-Maggetti.</strong>

        <p><strong>I am a musician.</strong> I play several instruments, focusing particularly on violin, mandolin and guitar. I also sing.
        <p>I make music in a variety of genres, including trad (with a particular interest in Irish and Québécois fiddle styles), choral, jazz, Balinese gamelan, and classical (with a particular interest in early music).
        <p>I have a B. A. in Music from the University of Waterloo and an M. A. in Music Theory from McGill University, where <a href="/etc/oliver-schroer/thesis/">I studied the music of Canadian fiddle player Oliver Schroer</a>.

        <p><strong>I am a teacher and a learner.</strong> I am always searching for more effective ways to think and work, and I've spent years learning about how people learn. I use this knowledge to acquire new skills and to learn about subjects that interest me.
        <p>I have decades of experience giving private music lessons, and offer lessons in violin, mandolin, guitar, and music theory. In my teaching, I draw on my knowledge of evidence-based learning techniques as well as my own experiences learning new things. I work hard to meet students where they are and focus on building musical skills that are directly relevant to their goals.
        <p>I also offer tutoring in effective learning techniques.

        <p><strong>I am a programmer.</strong> I worked for two years at the <a href="https://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca" target="_blank">Distributed Digital Music Archives and Libraries Laboratory</a> at McGill University, where I was lead developer for the <a href="https://cantusdatabase.org" target="_blank">CANTUS Database</a>. I also do occasional freelance web development work.
