			<strong>My name is Jacob deGroot-Maggetti.</strong>
		</p>
	
		<p>
			<strong>I am a musician.</strong> I play in many styles, from classical to bluegrass to jazz to trad. I play many instruments, from violin to mandolin to guitar to bass. I sing in and direct choirs. <a href="/music" target="_blank">Learn more about the music I make</a>.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			<strong>I am a learner.</strong> I am always searching for more effective ways to think, work and learn. I am an <a href="/bookshelf/">avid reader</a> with a thirst for knowledge. I work to develop new skills, learning by doing.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			<strong>I am a community builder.</strong> By directing choirs, leading jam sessions, performing at porch parties and busking at the local farmer's market, I aim to bring people together through music.

			<strong>I am a programmer,</strong> and I'm currently looking for a job as a software developer. I would like to work for a company that makes educational resources more widely available (think, for example, Duolingo, Brilliant, Codecademy, Khan Academy, etc.) and/or in a position where I can make use of my knowledge of music and music theory. If you would like to hire me, or are aware of an open position for which I might be a good fit, please do <a href="mailto:jacob@jacobdgm.com">get in touch</a>. For a sense of who I am and what I do, I encourage you to take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/jacobdgm" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a> and my <a href="cv.pdf" target="_blank">Curriculum Vitae</a>.
