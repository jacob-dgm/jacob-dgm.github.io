			<strong>My name is Jacob deGroot-Maggetti.</strong>

			<strong>I am a musician.</strong> I play in many styles, from classical to bluegrass to jazz to trad. I play many instruments, from violin to mandolin to guitar to bass. I sing in and direct choirs. <a href="/music/">Learn more about the music I make</a>.

		<p>
			<strong>I am a learner.</strong> I am always searching for more effective ways to think, work and learn. I am an <a href="/bookshelf/">avid reader</a> with a thirst for knowledge. I work to develop new skills, learning by doing.

			<strong>I am a community builder.</strong> By directing choirs, leading jam sessions, performing at porch parties and busking at the local farmer's market, I aim to bring people together through music.
