        <p><strong>My name is Jacob deGroot-Maggetti.</strong>
        I work to <a href="#musician">bring people together through music</a>.
        I'm also a <a href="#teacher-learner">teacher</a>, <a href="#teacher-learner">learner</a>, and <a href="#programmer">programmer</a>.

        <p id="musician"><strong>I'm a musician, and I work to bring people together through my music.</strong>
        I play several instruments, focusing particularly on violin, mandolin and guitar.
        I also sing.

        <p>I make music in a variety of genres, including trad (with a particular interest in Irish and Québécois fiddle styles), choral, jazz, Balinese gamelan, and classical (with a particular interest in early music).
        I work to bring people together by singing in and directing choirs, playing at and facilitating sessions, and playing for and participating in social dances.

        <p>I've sung in numerous choirs over the years, including church choirs, university ensembles, festival choirs, the <a href="https://grandphilchoir.com" target="_blank">Grand Philharmonic Choir</a> and Chamber Choir, and the <a href="https://www.orpheusmontreal.org/en/home/" target="_blank">Orpheus Singers</a>.
        Currently, I sing with <a href="https://www.seraphimmontreal.com" target="_blank">Seraphim</a>.

        <p>I have directed several choirs, acting as the director of the Ad Hoc, Post Hoc and Propter Hoc Chamber choirs as well as for a church choir, and serving as assistant conductor for the University of Waterloo Choir for several terms.

        <p>I'm active in the trad session scene around Montreal, doing what I can to build community, foster connections between musicians, and contribute to a welcoming atmosphere.

        <p>Over the years, I have spent a lot of time playing music for dancers.
        I was a member of the house band at the <a href="https://hepcatswing.com/" target="_blank">Hepcat Swing Dance Studio</a>, where we regularly played music for social swing dances.
        I have played at ceili, contra, balfolk and English country dances. I'm a member of Les Quatre Patates, a Montreal-based band focused on playing for contra dances.

        <p>I have a B. A. in Music from the University of Waterloo and an M. A. in Music Theory from McGill University, where <a href="/etc/oliver-schroer/thesis/">I studied the music of Canadian fiddle player Oliver Schroer</a>.

        <p id="teacher-learner"><strong>I am a teacher and a learner.</strong>
        I am always searching for more effective ways to think and work, and I've spent years learning about how people learn.
        I use this knowledge to acquire new skills and to learn about subjects that interest me.
        <p>I have decades of experience giving private music lessons, and offer lessons in violin, mandolin, guitar, and music theory, online and in-person in Montreal.
        In my teaching, I draw on my knowledge of evidence-based learning techniques as well as my own experiences learning new things.
        I work hard to meet students where they are and focus on building musical skills that are directly relevant to their goals.
        <p>I also offer tutoring in effective learning techniques.

        <p id="programmer"><strong>I am a programmer.</strong>
        I worked for two years at the <a href="https://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca" target="_blank">Distributed Digital Music Archives and Libraries Laboratory</a> at McGill University, where I was lead developer for the <a href="https://cantusdatabase.org" target="_blank">CANTUS Database</a>.
        I also do occasional freelance web development work.
