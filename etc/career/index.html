        <h2 id="im-looking-for-a-job">I’m Looking for a Job</h2>
        <p>
            I’m looking for a new job. This page is meant to be an informal
            summary of what I can do, what I have done, and what I’d like to do.
            <strong>It’s currently under construction!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            For a somewhat more formal summary of what I have done, a link to my
            “everything CV” will soon appear here, which includes all the things I
            might consider putting on a resumé and which would be distilled for any
            specific position for which I might apply.
        </p>
        <h3 id="up-front-tldr">Up-front tl;dr</h3>
        <p>
            I’m looking for job. I’d like to find a position either as a
            programmer, or as something else. I’ve spent the past year working as a
            web developer, using mostly Python and Django. I have a B.A. in
            Music with a minor in Geography, and an M.A. in Music Theory.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ideally, I’d like to find a position where I can make the world a
            better place while making a living. I can imagine myself being satisfied
            doing something related to either education or the environment.
        </p>
        <h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
        <p>
            There are a bunch of good things about my current job (I’m working as a
            web developer for the
            <a href="https://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca" target="_blank">Distributed
            Digital Music Archives and Libraries Lab</a> (DDMAL), at McGill University,
            where we make tools for musicologists), but I’d like to find something new
            for a few reasons. Personally, I’m not interested in spending multiple years
            of my adult life working as a programmer in academia. And from a big picture
            point of view, it would be ideal if the lab’s grant money, currently
            going to pay my salary, could instead go towards funding a current
            student.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Over the past year or so at DDMAL, I worked to reverse-engineer <a
                href="https://www.cantusdatabase.org" target="_blank">Cantus Database</a> (it used to run in Drupal,
                but we’ve rebuilt it in Django). I’ve been leading this project for the
                past 8 months or so.
            </li>
            <li>
                For my Master’s degree, I wrote a <a
                href="/etc/oliver-schroer/thesis/" target="_blank">thesis on the Canadian fiddle player
                Oliver Schroer</a>. I can research. I can write. I can communicate
                clearly.
            </li>
            <li>
                As part of my project of learning to code over the past couple of
                years, I bought a subscription to <a
                href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> and worked through a
                bunch of the courses there. I don’t place an enormous amount of stock in
                the courses I completed there - I think my
                <a href="https://github.com/jacobdgm/irish-tunes" target="_blank">unstructured</a>
                <a href="https://github.com/jacobdgm/kebyar" target="_blank">explorations</a> at
                the <a href="https://www.recurse.com" target="_blank">Recurse Center</a> and
                the <a href="https://github.com/DDMAL/CantusDB" target="_blank">work
                I’ve done at DDMAL</a> are much more valuable than the step-by-step courses
                on Codecademy. But hey, they gave me a <a href="codecademy" target="_blank">bunch of
                certificates</a> which I may as well put somewhere. And that may as well
                be here, even if only to give a general sense of the languages and
                concepts I’m familiar with.
            </li>
            <li>
                Over the past several years, I have also worked as
                <ul>
                    <li>a choir director</li>
                    <li>a music teacher, teaching violin, mandolin, guitar and beginner piano</li>
                    <li>an interpreter in a provincial park</li>
                    <li>a teaching assistant</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="what-id-like-to-do">What I’d like to do</h3>
        <p>
            I’ve learned that roughly 25 hours per week is a healthy and
            sustainable amount of work for me, so I’d like to find a job where I can
            take on such an almost-full-time workload.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve spent a bunch of time reading and thinking about how I can learn
            more effectively, and by extension how to teach well. With this in mind,
            I think I could be very happy working for a company that makes education
            technology products (two lighthouse companies/products for me are <a
            href="https://www.duolingo.com/info" target="_blank">Duolingo</a> and <a
            href="https://brilliant.org/about/" target="_blank">Brilliant</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            I really enjoy making and listening to music, and I’ve spent many,
            many hours over the past few years (during which time I completed a BA
            in Music and a MA in Music Theory) thinking and writing about how music
            works. It would be great to find a position where I can make use of this
            musical knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have interests in ecology and sustainability, and I would be happy
            if my job involved working to protect and restore the earth’s biosphere.
            Though it’s been a while since I’ve done any work academically in these
            fields, I began my undergraduate at the University of Waterloo in the
            Faculty of Environment, worked for a summer as a Natural Heritage
            Educator at a provincial park, and graduated with a minor in Geography
            and Environmental Management.
        </p>
        <p>
            As far as coding is concerned, I like working in Python and am
            familiar with Django, but I’m also open to and interested in learning
            other languages (Rust? Something functional?) or frameworks if
            necessary.
