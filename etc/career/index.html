            This page is meant to be an informal
            summary of what I can do, what I have done, and what I'd be interested

            Since May 2022, I've been working as a Software Developer at the
            <a href="https://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/" target="_blank">Distributed Digital
            Music Archives and Libraries</a> (DDMAL) Lab at McGill University. The lab makes tools
            for musicologists; my work there has been to develop and maintain 
            <a href="https://cantusdatabase.org" target="_blank">CANTUS Database</a>.
            CantusDB is built in Django/Python. I've been lead developer
            on the project since September 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            From May to August 2021, I was a participant at
            <a href="" target="_blank">The Recurse Center</a>, a self-directed retreat where I
            developed my programming and Python abilities while working on projects with other
            program participants. While I was there, I helped to build a
            <a href="https://github.com/jacobdgm/kebyar" target="_blank">tool for exploring
            the interlocking patterns found in Balinese Gamelan music</a>, and helped to
            <a href="https://github.com/jacobdgm/irish-tunes" target="_blank">train a neural
            network to generate melodies in the style of traditional Irish dance tunes</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think of myself as a mostly self-taught programmer. I learned a bit of HTML
            in elementary school an took a couple of programming courses in high school, but
            otherwise, I learned to program in Python by doing tutorials and
            <a href="codecademy" target="_blank">online courses</a>, reading books, and
            working on personal projects. These personal projects include
            <a href="https://github.com/jacob-dgm/jacob-dgm.github.io" target="_blank">this
            website</a> as well as a

            Since December 2022, I've also done a little bit of freelance web
            development. Most of it has been simple HTML, but I've done a bit of work with
            JavaScript too.

	<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
		<p>
			I've spent a bunch of time thinking about and making music.
			<ul>
				<li>
					In 2022, I completed an MA in Music Theory at McGill University.
				</li>
				<li>
					In 2017, I completed a BA in Music at the University of Waterloo.
				</li>
				<li>
					Lately, living in Montreal, I've spent a lot of time learning and
					playing trad music (i.e., "fiddle music").
					<ul>
						<li>
							I've played at sessions, mostly Québecois and Irish sessions,
							and mostly on fiddle and tin whistle.
						</li>
						<li>
							I've played music for contradances, mostly on fiddle, mandolin
							and guitar.
						</li>
						<li>
							I've busked, mostly on fiddle, mandolin and guitar.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Before the pandemic in Montreal, I participated in several musical groups
					in addition to busking and playing at sessions:
					<ul>
						<li>
							I sang with the Orpheus Singers.
						</li>
						<li>
							I rehearsed with Gamelan Giri Ketadon at the Univerity of Montreal.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					During my undergrad at the University of Waterloo, I participated in many
					musical activities:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            During successive summer terms, I directed the Ad Hoc (with the
                            exemplary <a href="https://evy.garden" target="_blank">Evy Kassirer</a>),
                            the Post Hoc, and two iterations of the Propter Hoc Chamber Choir, each a 
                            pickup chamber choir. We performed at the local library, local porch
                            parties, and at our own concerts where we raised money for local
                            charities.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I sang with the University of Waterloo Chamber and University Choirs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I played in the Conrad Grebel Balinese Gamelan Ensemble.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I played guitar and bass in the University of Waterloo Stage (i.e., Jazz) Band.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I served as music director at St. Joseph's Catholic Church.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I played guitar and bass in the house band for Hep Cat's Swing Dance Studio,
                            where I also facilitated weekly open jazz jam sessions.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

	<h3 id="learning-and-pedagogy">Learning and Pedagogy</h3>

    <p>
        I've spent a bunch of time thinking about effective learning and teaching techniques.
    </p>

<!--
I've spent a bunch of time thinking about effective learning techniques
Use these to do my own learning
Used them while teaching music students
Used them while directing choirs
Used them while TAing 
-->

        <p></p>

	<h3 id="environment-and-ecology">Environment and Ecology</h3>

<!--
Started my BA in Geography and Environmental management; graduated with minor in G&EM
Spend a bunch of time reading about ecology/evolution/natural history
Keep up on news about the environment
I'd like my work to contribute positively to humanity; addressing the climate crisis
    would help with this
-->

        <p></p>

	<h3 id="languages-and-linguistics">Languages and Linguistics</h3>

<!--
more of an interest than an aptitude at this point - mostly that I'd be happy if I could
    learn about languages/linguistics while I work
Developed an interest in linguistics around the end of my undergraduate; since then, have
    read books, watched many videos and listened to many podcasts on linguistics 
-->

        <p></p>

	<h3 id="community-building">Community Building</h3>

<!--
Especially around the end of my undergrad, community building was a common theme in many
    of my activities
    - leading HC jam
    - directing summer chamber choirs
    - attempts to set up session in KW
nowadays, I do what I can to participate in and enrich the overlapping communities in the
    Montreal trad music scene
