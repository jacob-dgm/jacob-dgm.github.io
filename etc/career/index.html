            This page is meant to be an informal
            summary of what I can do, what I have done, and what I'd be interested
            in doing.

            Since May 2022, I've been working as a Software Developer at the
            <a href="https://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/" target="_blank">Distributed Digital
            Music Archives and Libraries</a> (DDMAL) Lab at McGill University. The lab makes tools
            for musicologists; my work there has been to develop and maintain 
            <a href="https://cantusdatabase.org" target="_blank">CANTUS Database</a>.
            CantusDB is built in Django/Python. I've been lead developer
            on the project since September 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            From May to August 2021, I was a participant at
            <a href="" target="_blank">The Recurse Center</a>, a self-directed retreat where I
            developed my programming and Python abilities while working on projects with other
            program participants. While I was there, I helped to build a
            <a href="https://github.com/jacobdgm/kebyar" target="_blank">tool for exploring
            the interlocking patterns found in Balinese Gamelan music</a>, and helped to
            <a href="https://github.com/jacobdgm/irish-tunes" target="_blank">train a neural
            network to generate melodies in the style of traditional Irish dance tunes</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think of myself as a mostly self-taught programmer. I learned a bit of HTML
            in elementary school an took a couple of programming courses in high school, but
            otherwise, I learned to program in Python by doing tutorials and
            <a href="codecademy" target="_blank">online courses</a>, reading books, and
            working on personal projects. These personal projects include
            <a href="https://github.com/jacob-dgm/jacob-dgm.github.io" target="_blank">this
            website</a> as well as a

            Since December 2022, I've also done a little bit of freelance web
            development. Most of it has been simple HTML, but I've done a bit of work with
            JavaScript too.
