            Teaching Policies

        <p>It's exciting to hear you're interested in studying with me!
        Before your first lesson, please take a glance through the following policies and pieces of information:
        
        <h3 id="contact">
            Contact
        </h3>
        <p>If you need to reach me with something <strong>non-urgent</strong>, please <strong>email me</strong> at <a href="mailto:music@jacobdgm.com">music@jacobdgm.com</a>.
        I'll get back to you within a day or so (likely only a few hours).
        
        <p>If you need to reach me with something <strong>urgent or time-sensitive</strong>, please <strong>text me</strong>.
        You should already have my number.
        <p>If you don't already have my number, please let me know, and I'll give it to you.

        <h3 id="cancellation">
            Cancellations and Missed Lessons
        </h3>
        <p>If you need to miss a lesson, please <strong>let me know with as much advance notice as possible</strong>.
        If you cancel a lesson on short notice, I may request that you pay a cancellation fee.
        <ul>
            <li>If you give me <strong>7 or more days' notice</strong> to cancel a lesson, there is no cancellation fee.
            <li>If you give me <strong>less than 7 days' notice but more than 24 hours</strong>, there is a cancellation fee of 50% of the cost of the lesson.
            If we're able to reschedule the lesson to a time within 7 days of when it was initially scheduled, this fee is waived.
            <li>If you give me <strong>less than 24 hours' notice</strong>, the cancellation fee is 100% of the cost of the lesson.
            But if we're able to reschedule the lesson to within 7 days of when it was initially scheduled, the cancellation fee is only 50%.
            <li>If you give me <strong>less than 1 hour's notice</strong> that you'll be missing a lesson, I expect to be paid in full for the missed lesson.
            (Please try not to do this!)
        </ul>
        <p>If something comes up causing you to miss a scheduled lesson that you think warrants an exception, let me know, and we'll work out something that's fair.
        <strong>Conducting a lesson over a video conferencing platform like Zoom or Google Meet is always an option</strong> if you can't make it to a lesson in person.
        <p>For my part, if something comes up such that I need to postpone/reschedule a lesson, if I gave you less than 7 days' notice, the rescheduled lesson is half-price.
        <details>
            <summary>Why a cancellation fee?</summary>
            When someone schedules a lesson with me, I set aside a block of time for them in my schedule.
            This is time I could have made plans to do something else, like teaching another student, playing a gig, or inviting friends over to play board games.
            I also spend time preparing to teach a lesson in the days and weeks leading up to it.
        </details>

        <h3 id="duration">
            Lesson Duration
        </h3>
        <p>I always take the <strong>last 5 minutes of a lesson</strong> to get set up for a next student, take notes on what we covered, and start drafting up an email summarizing what we did and what to work on before a next lesson.
        <p>For example, if you have a 60-minute lesson scheduled at 1:00, the teaching portion of the lesson ends at 1:55.
        If you have a 30-minute lesson scheduled at 1:00, teaching ends at 1:25.

        <h3 id="rates">
            Rates
        </h3>
        <p>As of January 2025, my default rates for new students are:
        <ul>
            <li>For a single lesson: $75/hr
            <li>For a lesson in a series of lessons (three or more lessons in a row, say, with no more than a few weeks between successive lessons): $65/hr
        </ul>
        <p>I don't ever want cost to be something that stands between someone and a music lesson they'd like to take.
        <strong>If money is tight, please suggest a rate you can afford</strong>—I will almost certainly accept it.
        (And if it's within your means to pay a higher rate and you'd like to help subsidize others' lessons, do let me know!)

        <h3 id="payment">
            Payment
        </h3>
        <p>If you can, please pay by e-transfer to <a href="mailto:jacob@jacobdgm.com">jacob@jacobdgm.com</a> (<a href="mailto:music@jacobdgm.com">music@jacobdgm.com</a> is fine too).
        If e-transfer isn't a possibility for you, we'll find another option (likely cash or Paypal).

        <p>I'm looking forward to working together!
