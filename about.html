			About
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			Hello! I'm Jacob deGroot-Maggetti. I'm currently doing a Masters in Music Theory at McGill University.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I spend a lot of time playing traditional dance tunes, especially from Ireland. I've released a <a href="https://jacobdegroot-maggetti.bandcamp.com/album/irish-mandolin-vol-1">pair of</a> <a href="https://jacobdegroot-maggetti.bandcamp.com/album/irish-mandolin-vol-2">small albums</a> in this style, and you can find many more videos of me playing trad tunes on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCasUHqcRFrPnH7yDmbTsUKA/">YouTube channel</a>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I like singing in and directing choirs. I studied choral conducting with Dr. Mark Vuorinen at the University of Waterloo, and I directed the Ad Hoc (2016), Post Hoc (2017) and Propter Hoc (2018-19) chamber choirs. As a singer, I've performed with the University of Waterloo Choir, University of Waterloo Chamber Choir, Grand Philharmonic Choir (Kitchener-Waterloo), Grand Philharmonic Chamber Choir, and the Orpheus Singers (Montreal).

		<!-- add paragraph about being passionate about learning, pedagogy-->
		
		<p>
			I teach violin, guitar, mandolin, bass, beginner piano, and music theory (currently, I only offer video lessons, but I'll get back to offering in-person lessons once the world stops ending). If you'd like to study with me, <a href="mailto:music@jacobdgm.com">send me an email</a>.
