			About
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			Hello! I'm Jacob deGroot-Maggetti. I'm currently doing a Masters in Music Theory at McGill University.
		</p>
		
		<!-- add paragraph about playing trad music -->
		
		<p>
			I like singing in and directing choirs. I studied choral conducting with Dr. Mark Vuorinen at the University of Waterloo, and I directed the Ad Hoc (2016), Post Hoc (2017) and Propter Hoc (2018-19) chamber choirs. As a singer, I've performed with the University of Waterloo Choir, University of Waterloo Chamber Choir, Grand Philharmonic Choir (Kitchener-Waterloo), Grand Philharmonic Chamber Choir, and the Orpheus Singers (Montreal).
		</p>
		
		<!-- add paragraph about being passionate about learning, pedagogy-->
		
		<p>
			I teach violin, guitar, mandolin, bass, beginner piano, and music theory (currently, I only offer video lessons, but I'll get back to offering in-person lessons once the world stops ending).
		</p>
