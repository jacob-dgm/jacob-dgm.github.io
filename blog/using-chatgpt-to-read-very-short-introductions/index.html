            Using ChatGPT to Read Very Short Introductions
        </h2>
        <p>Following my birthday last month, the thought occurred to me that
        this could be a year of learning about topics I’m curious about by
        reading through as much of Oxford UP’s <a
            href="https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/v/very-short-introductions-vsi/"
            target="_blank"
        >Very Short Introductions</a>
        series as I can. As an informal experiment, while reading the series’
        entry on <a
            href="/bookshelf/amphibians-very-short-introduction.html"
        >amphibians</a>, I tried asking ChatGPT to give me some
        questions to answer by the time I finished reading the book. This blog
        post is a summary of how this experiment went.</p>
        <h3 id="other-ways-to-read-very-short-introductions">Other ways to read
        Very Short Introductions</h3>
        <p>Before reading <em>Amphibians: A Very Short Introduction</em>, I
        had read two other books from the series: the one on <a
            href="/bookshelf/intelligence-very-short-introduction.html"
        >intelligence</a>,
        and the one on <a
            href="/bookshelf/bacteria-very-short-introduction.html"
        >bacteria</a>.</p>
        <p>While reading <em>Intelligence: A Very Short Introduction</em>
        several years earlier, I took book notes as I normally do, copying down
        things I found interesting and things I thought I might want to
        remember. Looking back, I think I took <a
            href="/bookshelf/intelligence-very-short-introduction.html"
        >too many notes</a>.</p>
        <p>While reading <em>Bacteria: A Very Short Introduction</a></em> a couple
        of weeks ago, every time I finished a chapter, I wrote, from memory, a
        <a
            href="/bookshelf/bacteria-very-short-introduction.html"
        >summary of the information contained within that chapter</a>. This was
        inspired by a suggestion in the Coursera <em><a
            href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn"
            target="_blank"
        >Learning How to
        Learn</a></em> course that you can improve memory encoding after
        experiencing something you want to remember (at the end of, e.g., a
        book, a lecture, or a conversation) by writing down, on a scrap of
        paper, what you remember about the experience. You don’t even need to
        keep the scrap of paper - it’s the act of recalling from memory and then
        writing that leads to the benefits.</p>
        <h3 id="why-answer-questions-about-a-book-anyways">Why answer questions
        about a book, anyways?</h3>
        <p>If you’re trying to learn something from a textbook, one of the best
        places to begin when starting on a new chapter is at the very end of the
        chapter, with the questions. First, you do your best to answer them
        without having read the chapter (while doing your best to remain okay
        with the fact that you’re getting them wrong). Then, read the chapter,
        and experience a series of “aha!” moments, which happen every time you
        come across a piece of information that would have helped you as you
        were struggling with one of the questions. Ideally, once you finish the
        chapter, answer the questions again with your newfound knowledge.</p>
        <p>When you start by reading the questions at the end of the chapter,
        you find out what the authors are hoping you’ll take from the chapter.
        And by doing your best to answer them, you prime your brain to notice
        and remember these key bits of information when you encounter them.</p>
        <p>While my book on amphibians wasn’t a textbook, I wondered whether I
        could try a similar approach to help me come away from the book with
        more knowledge. The plan was to come up with a set of five questions
        that would guide my attention towards important pieces of knowledge
        about amphibians and their study. After attempting to answer the
        questions at the beginning, I would return to them every time I finished
        a chapter, seeing what I could add to my answers.</p>
        <p>The book, however, didn’t have questions at the end of each chapter,
        which meant I would need to come up with some…</p>
        <h3 id="so-why-ask-chatgpt-to-generate-these-questions">So why ask
        ChatGPT to generate these questions?</h3>
        <p>While I’ve become more pessimistic about the effects of widely
        available Large Language Models on education (not to mention society as
        a whole) over the past couple of years, I think that generating
        questions for a learner to respond to is one of their more useful
        applications. Generating questions about a book like this, in
        particular, plays to an LLM’s strengths, while sidestepping a number of
        potential pitfalls for learners: LLMs are good at having a general sense
        about a wide range of topics (whereas <em>I</em> would likely have a
        hard time coming up with good questions. I don’t really know the state
        of humanity’s knowledge about amphibians - that’s why I’m reading the
        book!). On the flip side, since I’m the one answering the questions, I’m
        not outsourcing the thinking I need to be doing in order to learn. The
        risk of being misled by hallucinations is much reduced, since I’m not
        asking ChatGPT to tell me any facts (And if it generates any nonsensical
        questions, the only negative effect is that, by the end of the book,
        I’ll be disappointed at having spent time puzzling over a question that
        I will know by then was useless).</p>
        <p>Before asking ChatGPT for questions, as a control, I figured I should
        come up with my own set of questions to see whether the LLM was doing
        anything I couldn’t do myself. My questions, and ChatGPT’s questions are
        listed below, along with the prompt I used.</p>

        </ul>
        <h4 id="chatgpts-questions">ChatGPT’s Questions</h4>
        <p>My prompt:</p>
        <pre><code>I am beginning to read a book about amphibians. While I feel I have a decent amount of background knowledge about the biology of life on earth, I don&#39;t know much about amphibians in particular, and I&#39;d like to learn as much as I can. Taken from the table of contents, here are the titles of the chapters the book contains:

        - what is an amphibian?
        - the evolution of amphibians
        - reproduction and life history
        - how amphibians move
        - how amphibians feed
        - the amphibians&#39; world: sense organs and communication
        - amphibians and humans
        - conservation and the future of amphibians

        Based on these chapter headings, please provide five questions I can expect to find the answers to by the time I finish the book - questions for me to keep in mind as I read in order to gain as deep an understanding of amphibians as possible.</code></pre>
        <p>ChatGPT’s response:</p>
        <pre><code>Here are five deep, guiding questions you can keep in mind as you read your amphibian book—each one aligned with multiple chapter themes to help you synthesize and retain a broad, nuanced understanding:

        1. What defining traits distinguish amphibians from other vertebrates, and how do these traits reflect their evolutionary history and ecological roles?
            → Think about anatomy, physiology (e.g. skin, respiration), and their transitional place between aquatic and terrestrial life.
    
        2. How do amphibians reproduce, and in what ways do their life cycles reflect both ancestral aquatic origins and adaptations to land?
            → This will touch on eggs, metamorphosis, reproductive strategies, and developmental stages.
    
        3. In what ways are amphibians adapted to their environments in terms of movement, feeding, sensory perception, and communication?
            → Look for variety across species and connections between form, function, and habitat.
    
        4. How have amphibians interacted with humans culturally, scientifically, and economically—and what impact have those interactions had on amphibian populations?
            → Reflect on amphibians in myth, medicine, research, and as environmental indicators.
    
        5. What are the primary threats facing amphibians today, and what conservation strategies are being used or proposed to ensure their survival? 
            → This question will help you connect the biological with the political and environmental realities amphibians face.
    

        Keeping these questions in mind will help you move beyond memorizing facts and toward understanding amphibians as a dynamic and vulnerable group within Earth&#39;s ecosystems.</code></pre>
        <p>For my answers, before and after, see <a
            href="/bookshelf/amphibians-very-short-introduction.html"
        >my book notes</a>. (I was
        actually most of the way through the first chapter by the time I
        generated these questions, so my questions and my initial answers
        actually reflect the state of my knowledge after reading almost one
        chapter of the book)</p>
        <h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
        <p>On the whole, I generally think this is a worthwhile practice, and
        plan to do it again. A few observations:</p>
        <p>For one of my questions (“How has what we know about amphibians
        changed over time?”), the book didn’t really contain any relevant
        information. Had I read the table of contents like ChatGPT did, I might
        have known to expect this. Oops! On the other hand, ChatGPT generated
        one question that I was initially doubtful about (the “Reflect on
        amphibians in myth, medicine…” bit), but for which there was actually a
        decent amount of information in the book. I might be able to
        pattern-match in the future, learning what sorts of questions to ask.
        But on the whole, this was the idea anyway: ChatGPT has a better sense
        of the broad outlines of the study of amphibians than I do, and it was
        able to come up with questions that I wasn’t.</p>
        <p>While I initially came up with my own questions as a control, I now
        think the practice of writing out one’s own questions is a useful part
        of the exercise. (This could also be a useful practice at the end of the
        book, too—one that’s useful for learners that come later. Having a goal
        of coming up with a series of learning goals / evaluation statements
        would be an interesting lens through which to read a book, too!)</p>
        <p>Ten questions in total, however, was too many questions, and I felt a
        bit bogged down at times at the end of a chapter while trying to flesh
        out answers to all ten of them. Perhaps in the future, I’ll come up with
        5 questions, ask ChatGPT for 5, and then look through them all and keep
        the 5 or 6 that seem most promising.</p>
