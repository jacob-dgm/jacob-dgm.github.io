			Tightrope in Space – Oliver Schroer with Emilyn Stam
		</h2>
		
		<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1">Tightrope in Space is a track from Oliver Schroer’s album <em><a href="https://borealisrecords.com/product/smithers/?v=e4b09f3f8402" target="_blank">Smithers</a></em>. Schroer ran an influential fiddle camp in Smithers, BC for several years. For each camper, Schroer composed a tune, and these 59 tunes are gathered together on this album. Schroer is accompanied on piano by Emilyn Stam, who arranged each piece.</p>

		<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="17">The melody of the opening two measures is compound, spelling out three voices:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="18">in the lower voice, an ascending chromatic line from D to F,</li>
			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="18" data-line-end="19">in the middle voice, a recurring A</li>
			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="19" data-line-end="21">in the upper voice, a chromatic enclosure, circling around C-sharp</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="22">The A section takes the form of a loose period:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="22" data-line-end="23">A 2-measure unit with a compound melody, as described above. The piano adds a fourth voice, moving in parallel thirds with the lower voice in the violin melody.</li>
			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="23" data-line-end="24">A 2-measure unit based on arpeggiated C-sharp minor and C-sharp diminished chords.</li>
			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="24" data-line-end="25">Repetition of the opening 2 measures, with an E replacing the initial D.</li>
			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="27">A 4-measure unit: the violin melody is largely based on an arpeggiated Am7 triad over a D that recurs in the instrument’s lower register. The piano plays II-V progressions, suggesting a possible turn toward C major.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=27 data-line-end=28 ><a id="B_section_27"></a>B section</h3>
		<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="28" data-line-end="29">The G13 chord that ends the A section leads not to a C major chord, but instead resolves upwards by step to an A minor harmony. The melody in the violin features a series of descending figures supported by various chords: Am9, Fmaj7 and D7. Each of these lines tends downward toward a B, a note which the violin then circles around and ornaments, supported each time by an Em7 harmony in the piano. This section, though it switches freely between measures of 3/4 and 4/4, sounds much more fluid than the A section.</p>
		
		<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=30 data-line-end=31 ><a id="C_section_30"></a>C section</h3>
		<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="31" data-line-end="32">The C section alternates between two tonal centres, each of which is spelled out through alternating harmonies. In the first three measures, the piano oscillates between G and C chords over a G pedal, suggesting a key of G major. In the following three measures, the piano alternates between E-flat and F triads over an E-flat pedal, with these two chords outlining the E-flat lydian mode (Eb F G A Bb C D Eb). It’s worth noting that this section also features a compound melody: a lower voice alternates between notes a whole step apart—first D and E, and then E-flat and F—while an upper voice reiterates a G through the entire section.</p>

		<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="34" data-line-end="35">Tightrope in Space moves through a range of emotions. To my ears, the chromatic lines of the A section create a sense of disorientation and slight peril – a fitting depiction of a person trying get their bearings in zero gravity. In contrast to the tortuous lines of the A section, the flowing, lyrical melody of the B section suggests a sense of wonder – what an astronaut might feel while floating in space, surrounded by stars. The C section sounds playful — I'm reminded of Apollo astronauts bounce-skipping across the moon.</p>
		<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="36" data-line-end="37">If I was pressed to identify one mood that runs through the piece, however, I would say that Tightrope in Space evokes a sense of curiosity: with its frequent changes in harmony and texture, the piece conjures up the image of a person in a new and unfamiliar environment, turning from one fascination to the next.</p>
		<p>Why did Schroer call the tune "Tightrope in Space" rather than something like "Spacewalk"? Here's a thought: note that throughout section C, the upper of the two implied voices reiterates a G, this note serving as a common thread that unites the section. We see similar recurring notes in the B section — the B that is encircled at the ends of phrases — and the A section – the A in the middle voice. This recurring A, played on the violin's open A string, suggests that the metaphor of a common thread is less abstract than it first seems: this thread is a thin metal wire stretched taut across a fiddle's frame. Is it too much of a stretch to imagine each section of the tune thus unified by its own "tightrope"?</p>
