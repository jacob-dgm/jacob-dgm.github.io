			Here’s Looking at Euclid: A Surprising Excursion Through the Astonishing World of Math – Alex Bellos
		</h2>
	
		<p>
			<strong>Thoughts:</strong> It’s been more than a year between when I
			finished this and when I finished converting my sticky notes into
			typed-up notes, but I remember quite enjoying <em>Here’s Looking at Euclid</em>. Nothing particularly deep or astonishing, but a good deal of good fun.
		</p>
		<p>(The notes below are not a summary of the book, but rather raw notes - whatever I thought, at the time, might be worth remembering.)</p>

		<ul>
			<li>3-4: discusses the research of Pierre Pica, who did field work
				studying the language of the Munduruku in the Amazon. Their counting
				system has words for natural numbers up to five
				<ul>
					<li>j: to what extent do examples like these lend credence to the Linguistic Determinism hypothesis?</li>
					<li>
						cf Cohn 2019, noting that “the tendency to subjectively metricize
						intermediate [pulses]… may be linked to human capacities for numerosity,
						as 3 is the point at which pre-verbal subitization begins to attenuate,
						eliding into mental systems informed by higher-level mental functions of
						verbalization and calculation”
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
						
			<li>5-6: the Munduruku (with their lack of counting words) tend to
				experience number logarithmically - if asked to put a mark on a line
				indicating the number of items of a thing, marks corresponding to 2 and
				3 will be much further from each other than those corresponding to 8 and
				9.
				<ul>
								
					<li>6: “It turns out that the logarithmic approach is not exclusive to
						Amazonian Indians. We are all born conceiving of numbers this way. In
						2004, Robert Siegler and Julie Booth at Carnegie Mellon University in
						Pennsylvania presented a similar version of the number line experiment
						to a group of kindergarten pupils…, first graders… and second graders.
						The results showed in slow-motion how familiarity with counting moulds
						our intuitions. The kindergarten pupil, with no formal math education,
						maps numbers out logarithmically. By the first year at school, when the
						pupils are being introduced to numbers words and symbols, the graph is
						straightening. And by the second year at school, the numbers are at last
						evenly laid out along the line.”
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
							
			<li>17: Bellos cites a study that “found a strong correlation between a
				talent at reckoning and success in formal math. The better one’s
				approximate number sense, it seems, the higher one’s chance of getting
				good grades. This may have serious consequences for education. If a
				flyer for estimation fosters mathematical attitude, maybe math class
				should be less about times tables and more about hunting skills at
				comparing sets of dots.”
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="chapter-one-the-counter-culture">Chapter One: The Counter Culture</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>37: “the irregularities of Western number words… Are of extreme
				interest to mathematical historians. The French for eighty is
				<em>quatre-vingts</em>, or four-twenties, indicating that ancestors of
				the French once used a base twenty system. It has also been suggested
				that the reason why the words for ‘nine’ and ‘new’ are identical or
				similar in many Indo-European languages, including French
				(<em>neuf</em>, <em>neuf</em>), Spanish (<em>nueve</em>,
				<em>nuevo</em>), German (<em>neun</em>, <em>neu</em>), and Norwegian
				(<em>ni</em>, <em>ny</em>) is a legacy of a long forgotten base eight
				system, in which the ninth unit would be the first of a new set of
				eight. Number words are also a reminder of how close we are to the
				numberless tribes of the Amazon and Australia. In English, ‘thrice’ can
				me and both three times and many times; in French, <em>trois</em> is
				three and <em>très</em> is very: shadows, perhaps, of our own ‘one, two,
				many’ past.”
			</li>
										
			<li>43: j: lots of interesting stuff about abacus. Should learn more
				about doing calculations by abacus at some point.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="chapter-two-behold">Chapter Two: Behold!</h3>
		<ul>
											
			<li>52: The pythagorean theorem holds not only for the areas of squares
				set against the sides of a right-angle triangle, but also for
				semicircles, pentagons, etc. - j: presumably, for any given 2D
				shape
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="chapter-three-something-about-nothing">Chapter Three: Something About Nothing</h3>
		<ul>
													
			<li>
				-91: Bellos describes the Vedic <em>vertically and crosswise</em> or
				“cross-multiplication” method of multiplication.
				<ul>
															
					<li>91: it’s “faster, uses less space and is less laborious than long
						multiplication. Kenneth Williams told me that when he explains the Vedic
						method to school pupils they find it easier to understand.”
					</li>
				</ul>

		<h3 id="chapter-five-the-x-factor">Chapter Five: The <em>X</em>-Factor</h3>
		<ul>
															
			<li>129: Log tables are useful because multiplication can be converted
				into addition plus a few lookups into a log table. If you add the logs
				of two numbers, the sum will be the log of the product.
				<ul>
																	
					<li>131: if you have a line with numbers marked out along a log scale,
						and want to multiply two numbers, use a compass to measure out one of
						the numbers, then slide the compass along the line until the first end
						is on the mark for the second number. The second end of the compass will
						be on the product of the two numbers
					</li>
																		
					<li>131-132: this is the principle by which slide rules operate, except
						slide rules have two rulers marked with log scales that slide past one
						another, obviating the need for the compass.
					</li>
				</ul>

			<li>
				154: “to date, no one has found a sudoku that has a unique solution
				with fewer givens than 17.”
			</li>
																		
			<li>
				159: Book mentioned: semiotician Marcel Danesi’s 2002 <em>The Puzzle Instinct</em>
			</li>
																		
			<li>
				Another book of puzzles: Claude Gaspard Bachet’s 1612 <em>Amusing and Entertaining Problems that can be Had with Numbers, (very useful for inquisitive people of all kinds who use arithmetic)</em>
			</li>
																		
			<li>
				170-171: discussion of Martin Gardner, something of a hub in the
				world of recreational mathematics, and has written books on math and
				other topics

				223: “the difference between insurance and gambling in casinos is
				that in casinos you are (one hopes) gambling with money you can afford
				to lose. With insurance, however, you are gambling to protect something
				you cannot afford to lose. While you will inevitably lose small amounts
				of money (the premium), this guards you against losing a catastrophic
				amount of money (the value of the contents of your house, for example).
				Insurance offers a good price for peace of mind. ¶ it follows, however,
				that ensuring against losing a non-catastrophic amount of money is
				pointless. One example is ensuring against the loss of a mobile phone….
				On average you will be better off if you don’t take out insurance, and
				instead buy yourself a new phone on the occasions when you lose one. In
				this way, you are ‘self-insuring’ and keeping the insurance company’s
				profit margins for yourself.”
			</li>

		<h3 id="chapter-ten-situation-normal">Chapter Ten: Situation Normal</h3>
		<ul>
																						
			<li>262: Book mentioned: Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s <em>The Black
				Swan</em>, in which he posits “we have tended to underestimate the size
				and importance of the tails in distribution curves. He argues that the
				bell curve is a historically defective model because it cannot
				anticipate the occurrence of, or predict the impact of, very rare,
				extreme events—such as a major scientific discovery like the invention
				of the Internet, or a terrorist attack like 9/11. ‘the ubiquity of the
				“normal distribution” is not a property of the world,’ he writes, ‘but a
				problem in our minds, stemming from the way we look at it.’”
			</li>
																							
			<li>French physicist Gabriel Lippmann, in a letter to Henri Poincaré:
				“everybody believes in the [bell curve]: the experimenters, because they
				think it can be approved by mathematics; and the mathematicians, because
				they believe it has been established by observation.”
