            The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself – Sean Carroll
        </h2>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3"><strong>Summary:</strong> Carroll argues in favor of a philosophical worldview he calls <em>poetic naturalism</em>. Poetic naturalism holds that there is a single universe which, at a fundamental level, behaves in a consistent and predictable way, but that there are many different, valid ways of talking about the universe. He supports this argument by discussing how we are able to learn about the universe (empiricism), how certain we can be of things (we can never be 100% or 0% certain of the truth of a statement, but we can come very, very close), what we know about the universe (at a fundamental level, the universe is highly predictable and likely deterministic), how new, complex phenomena can emerge from simpler systems, whether things like consciousness and human agency are consistent with a deterministic universe (as far as we can tell, they are), the limits of what science and reason can teach us (they can’t tell us how to build our moral systems, but they can warn us against the complacency of thinking that there exist fundamental moral values), and what we should do with this knowledge.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I found <em>The Big Picture</em> to be very compelling: while it challenged several of my beliefs, its largest effect has been to clarify my worldview: Carroll expresses ideas I have been grasping at but unable to clearly articulate, and explores some of their finer details and ramifications. The discussion of Bayesian reasoning was particularly valuable, as well as the idea that even if a category is invented, it still deserves to be thought of as “real” so long as it does a good job explaining the patterns we observe in the universe. Of all the topics Carroll raises and deftly handles, the issues in the book’s final section, “Caring”, are least well-addressed, and I’ll need to explore them further. That said, I’d recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding how the universe works.</p>

            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="42" data-line-end="43">25: in physics, you can make extremely simplifying assumptions (frictionless surfaces, etc.) and get useful results; in fields like biology, economics, such extreme simplifications don’t usually generate useful results</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="43" data-line-end="44">26-27: Aristotle thought every motion had a cause. People such as John Philoponus (6th C.), Ibn Sina (aka. Avicenna, ca. 1000), and Jean Buridan participated in a change in thinking, where motion is not <em>caused</em> by anything, but rather conservation of momentum is just a property of matter</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="44" data-line-end="46">28: cosmological argument (e.g. Acquinas, borrowing from Aristotle): the universe happens because of an “unmoved mover” - an immortal and benevolent God that makes the world tick. Once we abandon the notion of motion requiring causes, and we accept conservation of momentum, this argument falls apart. “The universe doesn’t need a push. It just keeps going.”</li>

            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="47" data-line-end="48">32: as far as we can tell, the universe behaves somewhat like a computer: you take an input (the state of the universe, i.e.the positions and trajectories of each particle), it does a calculation (the laws of physics), and you get an output (the state of the universe at a later point in time). An idea like this was proposed in the first millennium BC by “Ajivika, a heterodox school of ancient Indian philosophy”</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="48" data-line-end="49">34: two laws of conservation that we observe in the universe: conservation of momentum and conservation of information</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="49" data-line-end="51">35: Laplace’s argument (“Laplace’s demon”) is that “perfect information leads to perfect prediction. Chaos theory argues that slightly imperfect information leads to very imperfect prediction.” Since the two talk about different things, i.e. perfect vs. imperfect information, the two aren’t contradictory.

            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="54" data-line-end="55">39: “Not only do we seek order and causation, we favor fairness as well.” Melvin Lerner identified the “just world fallacy,” noting that people tend to blame victims for the unfortunate things that happen to them.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="55" data-line-end="56">40: Principle of Sufficient Reason: “For any true fact, there is a reason why it is so, and why something else is not so instead”. Carroll argues that this is a flawed principle: many facts have reasons, but some facts are “brute” - “things that are simply true, with no further explanation possible” - basic parts of our ontology.</li>

            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="60" data-line-end="61">43: the laws of physics don’t function along the lines of “cause” and “effect” - they are “simply patterns that connect what happens at different places and times” - on the level of particles, past and future are the same</li>

Progress comes, not from new discoveries in an imaginary science of morality, but from being more honest and rigorous with ourselves—from uncovering our rationalizations and justifications for behavior that, if we admit it, was pretty reprehensible from the start. Becoming better people is hard work, but by sifting through our biases and being open to new ideas, our ability to be good advances.”</li>
