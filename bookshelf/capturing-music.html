            Capturing Music: The Story of Notation – Thomas Forrest Kelly
        </h2>
        <p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I got <em>Capturing Music</em> for Christmas from a relative in 2016 or 2017, and evidently I thought highly enough of the book to re-read and take notes on it in 2018 once I had started taking notes on other books. It’s a beautiful book, filled with photos of the manuscripts it discusses, and I remember listening to the accompanying CD multiple times.</p>
        <p>(The notes below are not a summary of the book, but rather raw notes - whatever I thought, at the time, might be worth remembering.)</p>
        <div class="hr"></div>
        <p>Forrest Kelly, Thomas. 2015. <em>Capturing Music: The Story of Notation</em>. W. W. Norton.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>15: at the dawn of music notation, the “space represents time” metaphor already understood by all readers.</li>
            <li>35: words can act as musical notation if we already know the tune - e.g. “take me out to the ball game”</li>
            <li>43: accent markers as precursors to neumes - “grave, acute, circumflex used… for centuries to indicate direction, accent, and change of inflection.” “The use of directionality… was already built into these accent signs long before they were used for music.”</li>
            <li>57: to look up: relative weights in St. Gall notation</li>
            <li>59: “there is a lot of disagreement [about whether wait meant a change in volume or in duration], and it is interesting and instructive to listen to the same piece of chant interpreted by a variety of performers using a variety of approaches.”</li>
            <li>75: look up system of notation by William of Volpiano - included extra info about microtones, movement, etc.</li>
            <li>90: manuscript to look up, with Great Book of Organum: Biblioteca Medicea Laurenzeana Plut. 29.1
                <ul>
                    <li>99: another: Herzog August Bibliothek Wolfenbüttel Cod. Guelf. 628 Helmst.</li>
                    <li>106: another: Herzog August Bibliothek Wolfenbüttel Cod. Guelf. 1099 Helmst.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>118: substitute clausulae, or rhythmic versions of motets?</li>
            <li>139: “There are only 8 motets (in the style of Petrus de Cruce)” - look them up!</li>
            <li>147: “…the pecia system” for making multiple copies of manuscripts, like an assembly line - sometime in the 1300s</li>
            <li>150: Roman de Fauvel ms. with 169 items of music - look up these pieces</li>
            <li>157: <em>punctum additionis</em> vs. <em>punctum divisionis</em>. The former is inherited in our dotted half notes etc.</li>
            <li>162: motets of Philippe de Vitry: “technically complex… In their notation system [and] their… structure” - learn about!</li>
            <li>185: ms. to look up: Squarcialupi codex. Biblioteca Medicea Lorenziana MS Pal. 87</li>
            <li>186: <em>Ars subtilior</em>: learn more about!</li>
            <li>187: compositions of Jacopinus Selesses (Senleches) - learn about</li>
            <li>194: “Willi Apel, whose book <em>The Notation of Polyphonic Music</em>, 900-1600…”</li>
            <li>200-201: change in timekeeping from flow of time (e.g. hourglass) to successive units/divisions of time (e.g. clock)</li>
            <li>202: “reverse inflation of… short notes”</li>
            <li>207: “Written music is always partly memory, though. You have to remember what the sign means in order to play or sing the right note of the right length.”</li>
        </ul>
