            21 Things You May Not Know About the Indian Act: Helping Canadians Make Reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples a Reality – Bob Joseph
        </h2>
        <p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Having read this, I have a better sense of what the Canadian Indian Act is and how it has been changed over time. I came across a few facts I hadn’t expected (mostly about the Royal Proclamation), but there wasn’t much that really surprised me. Worth reading, but not a highlight.</p>
        <p>(The notes below are not a summary of the book, but rather raw notes - whatever I thought, at the time, might be worth remembering.)</p>

<ul>
<li>28-29: With the passing of the <em>Gradual Civilization Act</em> in the late 1800s, the Canadian government began granting citizenship and land to any first nations person who gave up their Indian status, in a process called <em>enfranchisement</em>. “Up until this Act was passed, relations between band councils and government representatives have been relatively cooperative[!] The nation-to-nation relationship as outlined in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 was gone and in its place with a relationship of acrimony and deep distrust.”</li>
<li>46: oof! cites BF Skinner for a point on how the environment shapes our behavior - that’s rather unfortunate</li>
<li>83: King George III’s Royal Proclamation “[confirmed] the international convention of the day that colonizing countries should conduct government business with the inhabitants on a nation-to-nation basis and recognize the inhabitants as owners of the lands.” This nation-to-nation approach was abandoned around the time of / following Canada’s constitution in 1867.</li>
