			The Discovery of Middle Earth: Mapping the Lost World of the Celts - Graham Robb
		</h2>
		
		<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Robb contends that, contrary to the barbarians the Romans thought them to be, the Celts were an advanced civilization. Drawing evidence from archaeology, ancient writers, and surviving place-names, Robb outlines how the Gaulish Celts had a sophisticated long-distance communication system and road network (much of which the Romans went on to re-use) and an advanced understanding of geometry and surveying.</p>
		<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> This is a weird book. The author devotes an early chapter to "I know this sounds like leylines..." hand-wringing. Those knowledgeable about ancient history may find the re-interpretations of historic sources interesting. While I'm not sure what to make of the map of place-names along solstice lines that Robb constructs throughout the book, I find his more general thesis - that the Celts were an organized, advanced civilization - sound.</p>
		<p>(The notes below are not a summary of the book, but rather raw notes - whatever I thought, at the time, might be worth remembering.)</p>

			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="14">29: indication of the sophistication of Gaulish road network/surveying: When the romans took over, they adopted the Gaulish league instead of the Roman mile</li>
			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">31: Caesar recounts how messages travelled with astonishing speed, shouted across the fields. Suggests that the Gauls had people stationed in strategic locations, ready to pass messages</li>
			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="16">32: Sound travels more efficiently through valleys than hilltop-to-hilltop. Robb suggests that over decades/centuries, the Gauls developed a vocal telegraph system based on local knowledge</li>
			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="17">33: Whistling language of Pyrinean shepherds - became extinct in the 1950s. Could be used to pass messages across distances of more than 3 kilometers</li>
			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="19">37: acoustic surveying technique: in a forest, two people stand a distance apart, calling out. A third person positions themself halfway between them. Listening to the calls of those three, a fourth person marks out points along the acoustic straight line.

					<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="18" data-line-end="19">technique was used by Persian road builders - cf. Isaiah, “a voice cries out in the wilderness… make straight in the desert a highway”</li>

			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="19" data-line-end="21">j: much of this (whistle language, acoustic surveying) could be related to Murray Schafer’s ideas of how people in the past were more attuned to sound than people are today</li>

			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="52" data-line-end="60">208: Once Gaul was incorporated into the Roman empire, its native people renamed their principal towns after the local celtic tribes, so Celtic place names are well-represented in France. e.g.:
