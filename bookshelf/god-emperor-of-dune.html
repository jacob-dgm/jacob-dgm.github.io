            God Emperor of Dune – Frank Herbert
        </h2>
        <p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I enjoyed God Emperor of Dune less than the <a href="dune.html">earlier</a> <a href="dune-messiah.html">books</a> in the <a href="children-of-dune.html">series</a>. There were several pronouncements by Leto II about intrinsic characteristics of males vs. females that haven’t aged well and/or made me feel a bit uncomfortable while reading.</p>
        <p>(The notes below are not a summary of the book, but rather raw notes - whatever I thought, at the time, might be worth remembering. I read this as an e-book, so page numbers are as they appeared in the app I used, Libby.)</p>

                99: “For what do you hunger, Lord?” Moneo ventured. // “For a humankind which can truly make long-term decisions. Do you know the key to that ability, Moneo?” // “You have said it many times, Lord. It is the ability to change your mind.”

                305: “[A] wise man observed that wealth is a tool of freedom. But the pursuit of wealth is the way to slavery.”
