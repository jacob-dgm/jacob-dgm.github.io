            Beginners: The Joy and Transformative Power of Lifelong Learning – Tom Vanderbilt
        </h2>
        <p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Not bad. <em>Beginners</em> discusses why it’s worth developing new skills as an adult, and includes some tips for how to acquire these new skills. Didn’t take that much from it.</p>
        <p>(The notes below are not a summary of the book, but rather raw notes - whatever I thought, at the time, might be worth remembering. I read this as an e-book, so page numbers are as they appeared in the app I used, Libby.)</p>

            <li>23 epigraph: “A man… progresses in all things by making a fool of himself.” - George Bernard Shaw</li>
            <li>26-27: <em>declarative</em> vs <em>procedural knowledge</em></li>
            <li>32: “In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities…. In the expert’s mind there are few.” - Shunryu Suzuki</li>
            <li>34: “As a sometime travel writer, I have a strategy: Take the most notes on the first day. That’s when you see the most. In the clumsily self-conscious early stages of skill learning, it can be hard to remember to take note of your surroundings.”</li>
            <li>40: “The skill of having perfect pitch, for example, which not only is exceedingly rare but has long been thought to be impossible outside a narrow band of childhood, can, as research from the University of Chicago has shown, be trained—if to not quite as high a level as those possessing ‘true’ perfect pitch—in some adults.” (!)</li>
            <li>45: “The linguist Michael Ramscar argues that some of what looks like cognitive decline in laboratory tests is actually just a function of learning. He has shown that when you ask younger and older subjects to memorize bunches of word pairs like ‘baby-cries’ and ‘obey-eagle,’ older adults do worse at the pairs like ‘obey-eagle.’ In a test result, this looks bad. ¶ But older adults, he maintains, have simply learned that over time we tend to hear words like ‘baby’ and ‘cries’ in the same sentence and tend <em>not</em> to hear ‘obey’ closely linked to ‘eagle.’ That latter phrase seems less important, so our brains don’t waste effort encoding it to memory.”</li>

        <ul>
            <li>197-198: “While we tend to think of feedback as a diagnostic tool for fixing mistakes, a growing body of research shows that people not only prefer to be given feedback on their <em>successful</em> attempts at a skill; they seem to learn better this way.”</li>

            <li>233: “Swimmers, as one long-term study found, lived longer than people with a sedentary lifestyle. This you’d expect. But they also seemed to live longer than walkers or runners, for reasons that aren’t clear.”</li>
            <li>262: “In science, if you know what you are doing you should not be doing it. [In engineering, however,] if you do not know what you are doing you should not be doing it.” - Richard Hamming</li>
