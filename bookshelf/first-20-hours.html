            The First 20 Hours: How to Learn Anything... Fast – Josh Kaufman
        </h2>
        <p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I had been wanting to read <em>The First 20 Hours</em> for a while, as Josh Kaufman’s experiment in learning to touch-type in Colemak was what prompted me to <a href="/blog/colemak">learn the keyboard layout myself</a>. The first three chapters contained all of the main ideas in the book, while the last six chapters (which I skimmed) were Kaufman applying what he learned to six specific skills he wanted to acquire. There were some useful reminders about best practices in skill acquisition, but I experienced no epiphanies while reading it. Not a bad book.</p>
        <p>(The notes below are not a summary of the book, but rather raw notes - whatever I thought, at the time, might be worth remembering. I read this as an e-book, so page numbers are as they appear in Libby.)</p>

        <ul>
            <li>23: There’s a difference between learning (i.e. learning discursive facts) and skill acquisition. Learning can be useful for skill acquisition, as it helps in self-correcting while developing the skill, but the two shouldn’t be conflated/confused.</li>
            <li>28: the Three-Stage model of skill acquisition:
                <ul>
                    <li><ol type="1">
                        <li>Cognitive (Early) Stage: includes preparation stages (learning about the skill) as well as early attempts to acquire it. The brain is actively engaged, focussing on small details/individual components of the skill</li>
                    </ol></li>
                    <li><ol start="2" type="1">
                        <li>Associative (Intermediate) Stage: brain is still engaged, but more holistically - includes practicing, noticing feedback/results, and adjusting based on feedback</li>
                    </ol></li>
                    <li><ol start="3" type="1">
                        <li>Autonomous (Late) Stage: unconscious mastery</li>
                    </ol></li>
                    <li>cf. the later three steps of the conscious/unconscious competence/incompetence matrix</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="ten-principles-of-rapid-skill-acquisition">2: Ten Principles of Rapid Skill Acquisition</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>32: Kaufman notes that in order to acquire new skills, some degree of immersion/time commitment is required - 5 or 10 minutes a day can maintain a skill, but you need to spend a good chunk of time on a skill to properly develop it</li>
            <li>34: when building a new skill, it’s important to understand the different component sub-skills that make it up. In doing so, you can identify the most important sub-skills and prioritize their development</li>
            <li>37: fast feedback loops are important: the longer it takes to receive feedback, or the less accurate the feedback, the more difficult it will be to acquire the skill</li>
            <li>39: Kaufman notes that in early-stage practice, quantity as well as speed are more important than the quality of the output
                <ul>
                    <li>j: this helps maximize the amount of feedback you’ll receive</li>
                    <li>do pay attention to form though, Kaufman notes, particularly when learning physical skills</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>42: “Contrary to popular usage, ‘steep learning curves’ are good, not bad” - where the learning curve is steep, big improvements can be achieved with relatively little input of time and effort</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="ten-principles-of-effective-learning">3: Ten Principles of Effective Learning</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>47: when acquiring a new skill, learning can make your practice more efficient
                <ul>
                    <li>48: a little preliminary research can go a long way when starting to acquire a skill. The purpose of this research is not to become an expert in the field, but to identify critical sub-skills</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>52: Kaufman suggests practicing/rehearsing inversions as a way to overcome hesitancy when learning a skill: what are the worst things that could happen, and if they happen, how am I going to deal with them. These scenarios are a useful way to identify critical sub-skills
                <ul>
                    <li>cf. the pre-mortem</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>56: Kaufman suggests that the ability to make accurate predictions is a good test of useful learning
                <ul>
                    <li>j: I should take a similarly experimental approach to subjects I’m interested in - this could be especially useful in coding</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        <ul>
            <li>97: “If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.” -Edsger Dijkstra</li>
            <li>114: to check out: Hacker News: “an ideal place to browse for at least semi-informed opinions on new developments in programming”
                <ul>
                    <li>j: to what extent is this still the case, several years later?</li>
                </ul>

        <h3 id="touch-typing">6: Touch Typing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>171: Colemak was only developed in 2006, by a computer programmer named Shai Coleman</li>
            <li>185: Kaufman would practice touch-typing before bed, noting that acquisition of motor skills is enhanced if followed soon afterwards by sleep, deep sleep being best (but naps are still helpful)</li>
            <li>186: other Colemak typists have stated that it’s possible to become colemak/QWERTY bilingual
                <ul>
                    <li>j: is it worth trying to do this at some point?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>189- : after Zipf’s law, which notes that letters, words and n-grams all follow a power law, Kaufman made a point of practicing common words and n-grams</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="go">7: Go</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>216: “<em>Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go</em>, often called ‘The Yellow Book’, is the book that most advanced players cite as the single text that helped them improve their game most dramatically.”</li>
