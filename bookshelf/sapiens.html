			Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind – Yuval Noah Harari
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			<strong>Thoughts:</strong> It’s been a while since I read <i>Sapiens</i>, but I remember it being a very thought-provoking book. Would recommend.
		</p>
		
		<p>(The notes below are not a summary of the book, but rather raw notes - whatever I thought, at the time, might be worth remembering.)</p>
	
		<div class="hr"></div>
	
		<ul>
			<li>
				31: stories invented by humans underlay the social structures of
				‘primitive tribes’, but “modern institutions function on exactly the
				same basis.”				
			</li>
			<li>
				35: “much of history revolves around this question: how does one
				convince millions of people to believe particular stories about gods, or
				nations, or limited liability companies?”
			</li>
			<li>
				51: “Ever since the Cognitive Revolution there hasn’t been a single
				natural way of life for Sapiens. There are only cultural choices, from
				among a bewildering palette of possibilities.”
			</li>
			<li>
				68: “Just as foragers exhibited a wide array of religions and social
				structures, so, too, did they probably demonstrate a variety of violence
				rates.”
				
			</li>
			<li>
				124: “We believe in a particular order not because it is objectively
				true, but because believing in it enables us to cooperate effectively
				and forge a better society”
			</li>
			<li>
				164: “Biology enables, culture forbids.”
			</li>
			<li>
				181: Culture is comprised of myths and fictions that tell us what to
				think and how to behave, in the service of allowing cooperation between
				people.
			</li>
			<li>
				239: When a culture believes in multiple gods, the gods’ powers are
				limited/partial, have interests and biases, and thus humans can make
				deals with them to advance the humans’ causes.
			</li>
			<li>
				247: Zoroastrianism, the most important dualistic religion.
				1500-1000 BC, prophet Zoroaster active somewhere in Central Asia.
			</li>
			<li>
				245-248: Catholicism is syncretic, combining polytheist, dualist and
				monotheist philosophies.
				<ul>
					<li>
						Monotheist: one omnipotent god
					</li>
					<li>
						Dualist: God vs. Devil, mind vs. body
					</li>
					<li>
						Polytheist: saints, ghosts, angels
					</li>
				</ul>
												
			</li>
			<li>
				269: “We study history not to know the future but to widen our
				horizons, to understand that our present situation is neither natural
				nor inevitable, and that we consequently have many more possibilities
				before us than we can imagine.”
			</li>
			<li>
				188-189: Francis Bacon argued that ‘knowledge is power’. “The real
				test of ‘knowledge’ is not whether it is true, but whether it empowers
				us. Scientists normally assume that no theory is 100 percent correct.
				Consequently, truth is a poor test of knowledge. The real test is
				utility. A theory that enables us to do new things constitutes
				knowledge.”
			</li>
			<li>
				305: “Scientific research can flourish only in alliance with some
				religion or ideology. The ideology justifies the cost of research. In
				exchange, the ideology influences the scientific agenda and determines
				what to do with the discoveries.”
			</li>
			<li>
				366: A country’s economic well-being today depends less on its
				natural resources and more on its credit rating.
			</li>
			<li>
				409: The sole universal characteristic of modern society is
				incessant change.
			</li>
			<li>
				447: to look up: Brazilian bio-artist Eduardo Kac and Alba, the
				flourescent green rabbit.
			</li>
			<li>
				456: to look up: scientists from Duke University who have trained
				monkeys to use bionic limbs.
			</li>
		</ul>
