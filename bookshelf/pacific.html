			Pacific: Silicon Chips and Surfboards, Coral Reefs and Atom Bombs, Brutal Dictators, Fading Empires, and the Coming Collision of the World's Superpowers – Simon Winchester
		</h2>
	
		<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1"><strong>Summary:</strong> Simon Winchester writes about cultural, political and environmental trends in the Pacific Ocean, focussing on the period from 1950 up to the present day. Instead of attempting a sweeping summary of the region's history, Winchester selects a handful of topics—the testing of nuclear weapons, surfing’s rise in popularity, the discovery of hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean, and so on—that he sees as representative of larger patterns.</p>
		<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> A decent book; Winchester is an engaging author. I particularly enjoyed the epilogue, with its discussion of how the indigenous people of Polynesia were able to travel freely from island to island, and thus represent one culture even while separated by vast expanses of ocean.</p>
		<p>(The notes below are not a summary of the book, but rather raw notes - whatever I thought, at the time, might be worth remembering.)</p>

			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="18">106: “Sony” - the name of the company - was chosen for its resemblance to the latin <em>sonus</em> and the association with the word “Sonny”, which had positive connotations at the time.</li>

			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="32" data-line-end="33">244: the best way, arguably, to measure/compare storms (e.g. hurricanes) is a storm’s <em>minimum central pressure</em></li>
			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="33" data-line-end="34">245: when compared by minimum central pressure, the most powerful Pacific storms dwarf the most powerful Atlantic storms</li>
			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="34" data-line-end="35">247: due in part to its specific heat, in part to its translucence, and in part to its ability to move/convect, water (i.e. ocean) is much better at absorbing/trapping solar radiation than most solids (i.e. land)</li>
			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="35" data-line-end="36">248: winds are named for the direction they come from. currents are named for the direction they’re heading.</li>
			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="36" data-line-end="37">254: winds have a powerful effect on the movement of water in the Pacific ocean - at times, the Pacific ocean can be 2 feet higher at its western coast than at its eastern coast.</li>
			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="37" data-line-end="38">263: of several cyclical patterns over the pacific, the Madden-Julian oscillation has one of the shortest periods - it recurs every 30-60 days, and brings hot, stormy weather to the tropical western Pacific</li>
			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="38" data-line-end="40">263-264: The Walker Circulation, which causes the strong trade winds that push the pacific around, and whose weakening causes El Niño, is predicted to become weaker due to global warming. A possible result is a switch to El Niño becoming the norm, rather than the exception.</li>

			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="53" data-line-end="55">431-432: James Cook and James Banks, while exploring the Pacific on the <em>Endeavour</em>, were guided by a Raiatean priest named Tupaia, who knew the names of ~70 islands around the Pacific and said he had visited many of them. He navigated by observing the water, the stars, and passing animals</li>
