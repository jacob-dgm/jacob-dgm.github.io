			Chop Suey Nation: The Surprising History and Vibrant Present of Small-Town Chinese Restaurants from Victoria, BC, to Fogo Island, NL – Ann Hui
		</h2>
		
		<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> My friend Jonathan recommended this book to me, and I’m glad he did: I really enjoyed it, finishing it in less than a day. <em>Chop Suey Nation</em> combines the story of Hui’s multi-week trip across canada to visit Chinese restaurants to gather stories with the story of Hui’s own parents’ immigration from China to Canada and their experience running a restaurant there. I found it interesting that the opening of the first restaurant in a region was often marked by initial innovation, with the owners quickly adapting traditional Chinese meals to fit Canadians’ sensibilities, but that this initial innovation was frequently followed by replication of a successful formula in nearby restaurants that opened later. A common theme was how much work these new immigrants put in to overcome obstacles, with many of these obstacles put in place by the Canadian government. The book left me hungry to go out and eat at independent restaurants.</p>

			<li>189: “MSG, or monosodium glutamate, is the ubiquitous ingredient in every Chinese kitchen all over the world. It makes everything taste better. But it was a controversial ingredient—a controversy that food historian Ian Mosby traces back to the 1960s, when a medical researcher posited in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> that a variety of symptoms he was experiencing (numbness, weakness and heart palpitations) were due to MSG. This bolstered pre-existing suspicinos of Chinese cuisine as ‘unclean’ or ‘unsafe,’ and quickly became known as ‘Chinese restaurant syndrome,’ despite the fact that MSG is used in a variety of foods, including cheese and baby food. And though the idea of MSG-caused discomfort has since been dispelled by science, many mistakenly continue to believe the ingredient is harmful.”</li>
