            Play It Loud: An Epic History of the Style, Sound, and Revolution of the Electric Guitar – Brad Tolinski and Alan di Perna
        </h2>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I came across <em>Play it Loud</em> at a used book sale. I came away from the book with two main things: first, a list of influential artists, albums and tracks to become more familiar with, and second, an appreciation of how electric guitarists have innovated and carved out their own niches by tinkering with their instruments (as well as their amps, strings, pedals, and other accompanying gadgets), usually in search of a particular tone. It’s inspired me to think more about and experiment more with the timbre of the instruments I play.</p>
        <p>(The notes below are not a summary of the book, but rather raw notes - whatever I thought, at the time, might be worth remembering.)</p>
