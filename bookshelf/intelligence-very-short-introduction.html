			Intelligence: A Very Short Introduction – Ian J. Dury
		</h2>
	
		<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Ian Dury outlines the history of the study of intelligence, as well as the current scientific understanding of it. While intelligence is an abstract concept, its utility has been well established: it can be used to predict many things, such as career success and longevity, and can give us insights into how the brain works. Intelligence is heritable and fairly stable over the course of one's life.</p>
		<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I found this book to be quite interesting. Dury supports each of his main points by looking at several scientific studies, and I appreciated that all of these were either metastudies or robust studies with very large sample sizes. With fewer than 200 pages, it wasn't a huge investment of time. This was my first Very Short Introduction, and I expect it won't be my last!</p>
		<p>(I took more notes than usual on this book, so it should come fairly close to a full summary.)</p>

I agree, and therefore I waited until here before offering one. Many people repeat Linda Gottfredson’s definition: ‘Intelligence is a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly and learn from experience. It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill, or test-taking smarts. Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings—“catching on”, “making sense” of things, or “figuring out” what to do.’”</p>
