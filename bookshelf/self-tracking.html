            Self-Tracking – Gina Neff and Dawn Nafus
        </h2>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> This was an OK book. In addition to laying out many of the forms self-tracking can take, Neff and Nafus outline a range of social and political factors relating to various self-tracking technologies and practices, both now and in the future. Chapter 3 had the most useful information, but I experienced no great epiphanies while reading it.</p>
        <p>(The notes below are not a summary of the book, but rather raw notes - whatever I thought, at the time, might be worth remembering.)</p>

        <ul>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">7: tension in self-quantification: self-tracking can be used for surveillance, privacy violation, for tailored ads etc., but can also be very practical for individuals when mindfully implemented.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="8">9: new term: exposome (the pollutants that bodies are exposed to) cf. genome, microbiome…</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">11: many current self-tracking applications just measure things, but don’t help people figure out what questions they should be asking, how they can run experiments, etc.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">12: goals of the book: outline how self-tracking practitioners go about tracking – some best practices. Identify areas where policies can be implemented so that self-tracking is better aligned with public interest</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">12: authors write from more of a cultural/social/observation standpoint, as opposed to a behavioural or technological one</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="12">15: Ben Franklin famously kept a daily log, but such diaries and journals were actually common in the 1700s</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">15-16: three general approaches:</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="14">“self-tracking” (e.g. Franklin - plays an active role in changing one’s life) and “life-logging” (more passive, supports personal reflection), and self-experimentation.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="17">24: various researchers argue that when people self track, they are:
                <ul>
                    <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="16">Outsourcing bodily management - relieves mental burden</li>

            </li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="18">25: authors think of self-trackers as transducers: capture some qualities of a signal but not all of them, and the ones they capture may be more or less correlated with the things we really want to measure</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="18" data-line-end="20">25: self-tracking lies near one end of a spectrum, with “other-tracking” lying at the opposite end
                <ul>
                    <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="19" data-line-end="20">25-26 E.g. pushed tracking (people are incentivized to self-track), imposed tracking</li>

            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="20" data-line-end="22">28: persuasive computing: the idea that computers can nudge people towards certain actions. Related concept: gamification</li>

            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="24" data-line-end="25">Many (but not all) biological traits lie along a normal distribution- people can get confused when comparing any one trait to the rest of a population. A value that is not “normal” may be perceived as a problem, whether or not it actually is. Cf. Medical model of disability</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="27">65: who owns data? We often think of ownership being binary, but anthropologist Bill Maurer suggests it may make most sense to think of data as having degrees of ownership (like kinship, he argues - you can be more or less closely related to someone). If data is from your accelerometer is turned into data on the number of steps you take using proprietary software, the data is a bit like a child - neither you nor the company could have made it alone</li>
