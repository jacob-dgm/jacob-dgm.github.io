            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1">Humans are always judging each other, and a large part of this is trying to discern others’ motives.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1" data-line-end="2">Since people are always judging us, we want to look good, so we “emphasize our pretty motives and downplay our ugly ones”</li>

        </ul>
        <p>In the first part of the book, they support this thesis with examples from psychology, ethology, sociology, and other fields. In the second part of the book, they explore the ramifications of this theory in various parts of society.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> This book has had a large impact on my thinking. My biggest takeaway has been that actions can be selfishly motivated, but can also be altruistically motivated, and importantly, these two motivations are not mutually exclusive. Best results are obtained when selfish goals and prosocial goals - the biological imperative to look out for yourself and the sincere human desire to help others - are brought into alignment.</p>

With that said, I took more notes than usual on this book, so it should come fairly close to a full summary.)</p>

But if you don’t do a thing because you’re worried a bunch of people will retaliate who aren’t directly affected by your action, that’s a norm.</li>
