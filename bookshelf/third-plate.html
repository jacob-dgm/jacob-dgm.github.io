            The Third Plate: Field Notes on the Future of Food – Dan Barber
        </h2>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I found this book in a little library and while it was a step in a new direction for me—I’ve read plenty of books on the environment and biodiversity, but almost none about food—I’m glad I came across it. <em>The Third Plate</em> is a pleasure to read, with lively anecdotes and a cast of colourful characters among the farmers and researchers he consulted in writing it. I came away from the book with a better understanding of the benefits and shortcomings of the world’s current food systems, and an adjusted mindset toward food, particularly ingredients that are varied and variable rather than standardized.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">(The notes below are not a summary of the book, but rather raw notes - whatever I thought, at the time, might be worth remembering.)</p>

            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="20" data-line-end="21">39-40: The Roller Mill, invented in the late 1800s, replaced the stone mill. Allowed the endosperm of a grain of wheat to be separated from its germ and bran. Flour ground in a Roller Mill had a longer shelf-life, since the nutrient-rich germ was removed rather than being ground in with the flour, meaning microbes didn’t have the nutrients they needed to grow in it.</li>

            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="27" data-line-end="28">53: up until the middle of the 20th Century, little was written about weed control. One of the rare earlier mentions is in a book from the 1930s by Bernard Rademacher, who said “vigorous plant stands are the best means for eradicating weeds”</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="28" data-line-end="29">54-55: Barber, after Eliot Coleman, states that while conventional farming treats symptoms (e.g. the appearance of a pest), organic farming identifies and addresses underlying causes – argue that the best way to control pests is to make sure plants aren’t stressed, as healthy plants have robust defence systems against pests</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="29" data-line-end="31">57-58: different weeds can serve as indicators of imbalances in soil chemistry, e.g. Queen Anne’s Lace, chicory -&gt; general low fertility, milkweed -&gt; lack of zinc, wild garlic -&gt; low sulfur, thistle -&gt; soil too compacted, etc.</li>

            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="36" data-line-end="38">87: phytonutrients (nutrients synthesized by plants) are largely responsible for a plant’s flavour. They’re largely produced as part of a plant’s immune system.

            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="39" data-line-end="40">93: large organic operations are referred to by Eliot Coleman as “shallow organic” and by Michael Pollan as “industrial organic” - don’t use chemical fertilizers/pesticides, but grow crops in monocultures, tend to maximize for short-term profit rather than long-term soil health, etc.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="40" data-line-end="41">95: 1942 study of soil health vs. draft rejection in Missouri, as the US entered WWII - men from areas with degraded soil were rejected at twice the rate as men from areas with more mineral-rich soil</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="45">95: biomass dilution: plants are bred/fertilized to grow bigger (effectively, maximizing for carbohydrate production), but with similar levels of other nutrients per plant.
