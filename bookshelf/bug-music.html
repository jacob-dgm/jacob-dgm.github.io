			Bug Music: How Insects Gave Us Rhythm and Noise – David Rothenberg
		</h2>
	
		<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I didn’t find this book’s thesis—that insect noises were a significant impetus and inspiration for musical expression, if I’m recalling it correctly—to be persuasively argued. In any case, Rothenberg’s enthusiasm about insect sounds shines through on every page.</p>
		<p>(The notes below are not a summary of the book, but rather raw notes - whatever I thought, at the time, might be worth remembering. Further, these notes are a more-or-less direct transcription of notes I wrote in a notebook years ago - I don’t fully understand why I wrote down some of the things I did, but presumably past Jacob thought present/future Jacob might benefit from tracking down and following up on some of the things mentioned.)</p>
