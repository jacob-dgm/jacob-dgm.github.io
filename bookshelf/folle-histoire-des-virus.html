            La folle histoire des virus – Tania Louis
        </h2>
        <p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> <em>La folle histoire des virus</em> outlines what we know about viruses, and how we came to know it. Near the end of the book, there’s a nice discussion about the question of whether viruses are alive or not, which I appreciated. I read it as part of my effort to improve my French comprehension, and I feel that, more than with any of the other French-language books I’ve read, I came away from <em>La folle histoire des virus</em> with a handful of useful words and expressions that I can use in other situations (i.e., not only vocabulary related to viruses!).</p>

            Some vocabulary highlights:
            <ul>
                <li><em>désormais</em>: currently, as of now - something wasn’t the case in the past, but it is the case at the moment and will be indefinitely into the future.</li>
                <li><em>auparavant</em>: earlier, before then - something was the case in the past, but at a certain specified moment, it ceased to be the case, and is expected to continue not to be the case indefinitely.</li>
                <li><em>au fur et à mesure</em>: describes an assembly-line sort of situation - if you take some action <em>au fur et à mesure</em>, it means that, as items become ready/available for you to act upon them, you do so, one by one.</li>
                <li><em>vraisemblablement</em>: likely, probably. <em>Vraisemblable</em> (seeming to be true) is to <em>vraisemblablement</em> as <em>lent</em> (slow) is to <em>lentement</em> (slowly) in appearance, but not quite in meaning.</li>
            </ul>
