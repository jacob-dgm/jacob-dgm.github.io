            Atomic Habits: An Easy &amp; Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Old Ones – James Clear
        </h2>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1"><strong>Summary:</strong> This book’s first three chapters outline Clear’s model of the habit. Each habit has four components—Cue, Craving, Response and Reward—which occur in succession, and Clear argues that any new habit will not stick if it is deficient in any of these four components. The remaining chapters of the book expand on these four steps, offering examples of how to apply them to build new habits and to break old, unwanted ones.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I enjoyed <em>Atomic Habits</em> - Clear is an engaging writer, and there was a good balance of anecdotes to theory. Occasionally, he will generalize too broadly in citing a specific study as evidence for one of his concepts, but on the whole, I found that his model provides a useful and practical way to go about shaping one’s own habits. I appreciated how each chapter concluded with a summary of key points - more authors should do this!</p>
        <p>(The notes below are not a summary of the book, but rather raw notes - whatever I thought, at the time, might be worth remembering. With that said, I took more notes than usual on this book, so it should come fairly close to a full summary.)</p>

            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="18">15-16: Clear talks about how becoming 1% better every day compounds, and by the end of the year, you’ve improved 37-fold. j: this would be true of money, but the comparison to habit forming is certainly overblown. Diminishing returns happen in most domains, and they would surely cut away from this.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="18" data-line-end="19">18: Clear argues that you should worry less about where you are now, and more about your trajectory. Is your current trend one of improvement, one of stagnation, or one of atrophy?</li>

            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="23">26: one of the problems with focusing to much on goals is that you can end up postponing happiness until you reach the goal (and this happiness is fleeting when you reach the goal). But if you have a good system, you’re free to enjoy the process.</li>

            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="24" data-line-end="25">summary of chapter: one of the most effective ways to build a new habit is to associate that habit with your identity. Sometimes, this requires you to change what you identify with.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26">33: The more pride you take in an aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be cultivate habits associated with it.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="26" data-line-end="27">34: “Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.”</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="27" data-line-end="28">34: When people believe in some aspect of their identity, they tend to act in ways that are consistent with that belief - cf. cognitive dissonance</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="28" data-line-end="29">37: In order to figure out their identity, people look for evidence - “do I often go to movies? I do! Therefore I identify as a movie-goer.” - so each of your actions contributes to shaping your own identity.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="29" data-line-end="30">38: lots of small actions can add up to significant change in identity. “This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change.” j: it’s important to remember this in other domains too!</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="30" data-line-end="31">39: if you’re not sure what identity you want, you can start with a goal and work backwards: “what kind of person would have {blank}?”</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="31" data-line-end="33">40: habits and identity are a feedback loop: habits shape identity, which can reinforce habits.</li>

            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="35" data-line-end="36">45-46: habits allow you to skip problem solving and go directly to a solution.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="36" data-line-end="38">46: “the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain.” Habits help free up working memory, by relegating tasks to non-conscious parts of the brain.
                <ul>
                    <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="37" data-line-end="38">46-47: good habits thus create freedom rather than restricting it - they allow you to focus on the creative, meaningful things rather than having to approach each task from first principles.</li>

            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="51" data-line-end="52">61: The strength (and the danger) of habits is that we don’t need to be aware of a cue to launch into the habit</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="52" data-line-end="53">62: Karl Jung: “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.”</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="53" data-line-end="54">63: Pointing-and-calling: safety system to reduce mistakes, by making observations explicit. All necessary details for performing an action are pointed at and stated out loud (cf. checklists). Effective because it raises unconscious habits to the conscious level.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="54" data-line-end="55">64-65: The Habits Scorecard: Clear’s way of making one aware of one’s habits. Simply make a list of your daily habits as you go through a day. Afterwards, label the list with +, - and = for good, bad and neutral habits respectively.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="55" data-line-end="56">65: “all habits serve you in some way—even the bad ones—which is why you repeat them.” The question is whether they serve you well in the long term or not.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="56" data-line-end="58">66: pointing-and-calling can be an effective first step toward conquering bad habits. Identify, out loud, the action you’re tempted to do, and the long-term effects of that habit.</li>

        <ul>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="59" data-line-end="60">70: In order to make a new habit stick, you need to sort out an <em>implementation intention</em> - exactly what the cue will be, and exactly what action you’ll perform when you receive the cue.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="60" data-line-end="61">70: voter turnout increases when people are prompted to create implementation intentions: “when will you vote, what route will you take to get there…” etc.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="61" data-line-end="62">70-71: “the punch line is clear: people who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through.”</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="62" data-line-end="63">71: “Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity. It is not always obvious when and where to take action.” The idea is to have a plan, and when the time (/place) comes to perform the action, there is no need to make a decision - just follow the plan.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="63" data-line-end="64">73: Diderot effect: The tendency for one purchase to lead to another. Similar patterns can be found throughout human activity, where one action leads to another: e.g. washing your hands leads to drying your hands. Each action is a cue that triggers the next action.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="64" data-line-end="65">74: Take advantage of this using Habit Stacking: “After I {current habit}, I will {new habit}.” Eventually, you can form entire series of habits</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="65" data-line-end="70">76-77: Can also design habit stacks for situations you expect to come across during the day. A couple of good specific suggestions:
                <ul>
                    <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="66" data-line-end="67">“When I walk into a party, I will introduce myself to someone I don’t know yet”</li>
                    <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="67" data-line-end="68">“When I want to buy something over $100, I will wait 24 hours before purchasing.”</li>
                    <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="68" data-line-end="69">“When I serve myself a meal, I will always put veggies on my plate first.”</li>
                    <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="69" data-line-end="70">“When I buy something, I will give something away.”</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="70" data-line-end="72">77-78: identify potential base layers for habit stacks by creating two lists: one with things that you do every day without fail, and one of things that happen to you every day without fail.

            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="73" data-line-end="74">83: In many cases (particularly when we’re consuming/buying things), our decisions are shaped by our environment - what’s obvious and clearly available - much more than we often realize.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="74" data-line-end="75">84: Clear cites studies claiming that we have ~11 million sensory receptors and ~10 million of them are dedicated to sight, and that half of a brain’s resources are used on vision. j: Both figures seem unreasonably high.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="75" data-line-end="76">85: if a cue is not obvious, it’s less likely to trigger a habit.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="76" data-line-end="77">87: an entire context/environment can act as a cue, especially for habits that are deeply ingrained.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="77" data-line-end="78">87: re: designing spaces: Clear suggests thinking of one’s environment as a collection of relationships/interactions rather than a collection of objects. i.e. <em>this</em> is where I {}, and <em>this</em> is what I use to {}, etc. j: cf. affordances</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="78" data-line-end="79">88: habits can be easier to change while you’re in a new environment. “It is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a new habit in the face of competing cues.”</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="79" data-line-end="81">89: Clear suggests, whenever possible, making a point of not associating one context with multiple habits. “When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits—and the easier ones will usually win out.”</li>

            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="82" data-line-end="83">91-92: Many soldiers in the Vietnam War became heroin addicts, but when they returned from Vietnam, many of them were able to break the habit (since all the cues related to that habit were removed). This challenged the belief, held at the time, that heroin addiction was effectively permanent, and due to a moral failure</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="83" data-line-end="84">93: “The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least.” The easiest way to become a more disciplined person is “by creating a more disciplined environment.”</li>

            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="91" data-line-end="92">103: supernormal stimuli, e.g. the red dots on herring gulls’ beaks - when the stimulus is exaggerated, it can lead to an enthusiastic response. Much marketing, product design today is centred around creating <em>supernormal stimuli</em> (e.g. food science). When faced with stimuli like ultra-sweet, ultra-fatty foods, it’s easy to understand why people pick up bad habits related to eating.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="92" data-line-end="93">104: we can take advantage of this phenomenon by crafting attractive stimuli that encourage us to follow good habits.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="93" data-line-end="94">106: we take action not based on a the reward, but based on the anticipation of the reward.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="94" data-line-end="95">106: the parts of our brains associated with anticipating a reward are the same as those associated with receiving a reward.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="95" data-line-end="96">109-110: temptation bundling. If there’s an activity that you really enjoy doing, and you commit to doing it only while performing a habit you want to build, you will come to crave the habit.</li>
            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="96" data-line-end="98">110: can be combined with habit stacking. Start with a habit you already have, then perform the habit you want to build, then reward yourself with a habit you already enjoy.</li>

            <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="143" data-line-end="144">188: <em>time inconsistency</em>: humans tend to value rewards differently depending on when we expect to receive them. A slight tendency towards this is adaptive, but sometimes it can lead us astray.</li>
