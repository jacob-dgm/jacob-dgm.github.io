            Annihilation – Jeff VanderMeer
        </h2>
        <p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I found <em>Annihilation</em> in a <a href="https://fivebooks.com/best-books/the-best-sci-fi-novels-of-the-past-decade-sylvia-bishop/" target="_blank">FiveBooks list of recent science fiction novels</a>. My interest was piqued when it was stated that the book was inspired by “a walk through a wildlife refuge,” and that aspect of the story indeed appealed to me. I found it to be well-written, and quite enjoyed reading it.</p>
        <p>A bit like Lois Lowry’s <em>The Giver</em>, I felt that even though many questions were left unanswered at the end, the closing paragraphs felt like a suitable conclusion, and I was a bit disappointed to see the last pages of the book listing a series of sequels.</p>
