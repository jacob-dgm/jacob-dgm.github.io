			Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain – Oliver Sacks
		</h2>
	
		<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1"><strong>Summary:</strong> Referring to psychological studies, case studies from the literature, and the experiences of his own correspondents and patients, Oliver Sacks explores how the human brain responds to, processes, and creates music. Many distinct neural processes are involved in making sense of music.</p>
		<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="4"><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I found this book worthwhile but not earth-shattering. Even as Sacks writes about his “patients”, he makes a point emphasising their individuality and humanity rather than treating them as “subjects”. The chapters on synesthesia and Williams syndrome interested me most.</p>

		<ul>
			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="14">x: Debate about whether music or speech evolved first has been ongoing since the 19th century. Among early thinkers on the topic:
				<ul>
					<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="12">Darwin believed music arose first, for courtship and to express moments of passion, and that speech arose secondarily.</li>
					<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">Herbert Spencer believed that speech came first, and music arose from emotional speech.</li>
					<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="14">Rousseau believed that speech and music arose in tandem, and later became separated.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="16">xiii: historical musical case histories are rare. Sacks speculates that patients were rarely asked about disorders of musical perception (whereas disorders of language were clearly apparent), or that there was no neuroscience to describe music before the 1980s, so neurologists were less likely to write up case histories which they couldn’t draw on existing theory for.</li>

			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="31" data-line-end="32">32: Sacks cites Alvaro Pascual-Leone: a combination of physical and mental practice leads to more performance improvement than physical practice alone</li>
			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="32" data-line-end="33">36: we can form mental associations between pieces of music and all manner of other stimuli, for example lyrics, an object, the taste of a particular food… Very often, these associations act subconsciously, the connection becoming explicit after the fact (if at all)</li>

She draws a parallel to perceptions of phantom limbs, where it may feel that the limb becomes shorter over time</li>
			<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="47" data-line-end="48">61: musical hallucinations are very common. earlier, it had been proposed that they were caused by temporal lobe epilepsy, but incidence of TLE seems to be too low to account for all musical hallucinations.</li>

Things like speech, music therapy work in part by cajoling the neurons of the penumbra into participating in larger neuronal patterns, eventually allowing them to regain function.</li>
