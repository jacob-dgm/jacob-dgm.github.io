            Nexus: Small Worlds and the Groundbreaking Science of Networks – Mark Buchanan
        </h2>
        <p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I enjoyed reading <em>Nexus</em> - it
            offers a clear and approachable introduction to discoveries in the study
            of networks (or rather, the state of its study two decades ago). Solid
            book.</p>

                    <li>43: Social networks tend to have <em>clusters</em> - where most of
                        the people a person is connected to are connected to each other - and
                        <em>bridges</em> - connections from a person in one cluster to a person
                        in another cluster. Mark Granovetter’s studies of social networks show
                        that, almost without exception, bridges are formed from weak links
                        rather than strong links.</li>

                    <li>54: Networks of randomly-connected nodes have the “small world”
                        property that one can traverse from one node to any other in a small
                        number of steps, but they are not very clustered. But Duncan Watts and
                        Steve Strogatz’s studies of “Small World” networks have both the small
                        world property, and are also highly clustered (Small World networks are
                        formed by beginning with an ordered network, where nodes are connected
                        to all nodes nearby them, with the addition of a few random connections
                        between nodes)</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>88: In many real-world networks, there exist “hubs” that are
                        connected to an outsized number of nodes. A study by physicists Ricard
                        Solé and Ramon Ferrer i Cancho has found that the words of the English
                        language form a small world (if words that appear next to each other
                        somewhere in a corpus are thought of as being connected), with words
                        like <em>the</em>, <em>a</em>, <em>at</em> functioning as hubs</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>118-119: the small world networks Watts and Strogatz modelled did
                        not grow and were “egalitarian”, with all nodes possessing roughly the
                        same number of connections. Networks that grow over time, in contrast,
                        tend to be “aristocratic”, with a few nodes acting as hubs with many
                        connections and many hubs having very few links
                        <ul>
                            <li>“In contrast [to Watts and Strogatz’s networks], highly connected
                                hubs or connecters dominate the networks of Albert and Barabási. The
                                historical mechanism of the rich getting richer leads without fail to
                                connectors, who, by virtue of having so many links, naturally play a
                                role similar to that of Granovetter’s bridges”</li>
                            <li>“So there are, it seems, two flavours of small: egalitarian networks
                                in which all the elements have roughly the same number of links, and
                                aristocratic networks characterized by spectacular disparity.”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>125: “small-world networks of the egalitarian variety, <em>à la</em>
                    Watts and Strogatz, are far more than mere mathematical curiosities.
                    Like the aristocratic networks of the World Wide Web or the Internet,
                    small-world networks of the egalitarian kind can emerge from a simple
                    process of history and growth. Whenever limitations or costs eventually
                    come into play to impede the richest getting still richer, then a
                    small-world network becomes more egalitarian, as seems to be the case
                    with the airports [Buchanan had just discussed how the growth of large
                    airports such as Chicago’s O’Hare tends to slow once they reach a
                    certain size and congestion and delays become a problem] and a number of
                    other real-world networks.”</li>
                <li>131: physicists Réka Albert, Hawoong Jeong and Albert-László
                    Barabási tried modelling cyber-attacks on the World Wide Web. They found
                    that for a randomly-connected network, if they removed nodes at random,
                    the network quickly fell apart. In contrast, in an aristocratic
                    small-world network (like that of the World Wide Web), the network was
                    quite robust, withstanding many random removals without its diameter
                    (the average number of steps required to connect a randomly-chosen pair
                    of nodes) increasing very much.</li>

                <li>158: after talking about phase transitions in the behavior of
                    networks: “Much of modern physics now is not really about matter at all,
                    but about discovering the laws of form in networks of interacting
                    things—not only atoms and molecules, but also bacteria and people.”</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>178: modelling the spread of diseases: whereas in a clustered,
                        non-small-world network, an infectious disease always runs out of steam
                        as it kills off nodes and nodes that recover become immune, the presence
                        of random long-distance connections can cause the disease to spread to a
                        greater proportion of the population. Once the proportion of links that
                        are long-distance becomes great enough, the network reaches a tipping
                        point and the disease infects the entire network. This sort of phase
                        transition occurs no matter what value R is set to.
                    <ul>
                        <li>“What pushes the epidemic over the edge is not the likelihood of it
                            moving from one person to another, but a change in the very architecture
                            of the social network.”</li>

            <ul>
                <li>185: Thomas Schelling’s simulations with “people” living on a grid -
                    each person has an attribute (“white” or “black”). At every step in the
                    simulation, people could get up and move to a different square on the
                    grid if they were dissatisfied with their current location. When
                    Schelling added stipulation that people disliked being in the
                    <em>extreme</em> minority among their neighbours (i.e. if they’re the
                    only “black” person among all their neighbours), they would move, the
                    grid became segregated, with enclaves of all “white” people separated
                    from enclaves with all “black” people. “The slight preference of the
                    individual to avoid an extreme minority has the paradoxical but
                    inexorable effect of obliterating mixed communities altogether”</li>
                <li>191-192: Simulation by Jean Philippe Bouchard and Marc Mézard, where
                    simulated people had different amounts of wealth, and people could
                    either exchange things with each other, or invest their wealth. People
                    with more wealth were better able to withstand the shocks of investment
                    prices fluctuating. Each person was programmed to behave similarly
                    (i.e. each had identical “money-making” skills), but when the simulation
                    ran, there would always be some people who ended up with enormously more
                    wealth than the others, and the distribution of wealth followed Pareto’s
                    law
                <ul>
                    <li>this result was robust no matter how they set the balance between
                        the tendency to “exchange” and to “invest”</li>
                    <li>192: “The discovery suggests that the temptation to find complex
                        explanations behind the distribution of wealth may be seriously
                        misguided.”</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>193: It’s important to note that Pareto’s law does not stricly imply
                an 80-20 distribution: it’s just that the distribution trails off in a
                particular way - it is fat-tailed - but the specific proportions can
                vary</li>
            <li>193: observing the results of multiple runs of this simulation with
                different conditions: “encouraging exchange between people, with other
                things being equal, will tend to distribute wealth more equitably.
                Bouchard and Mézard found greater equality whenever they boosted the
                flow of wealth among the links or increased the number of such links.
                Alternatively, stirring up the wildness and unpredictability of
                investment returns worked in the opposite direction.”
                <ul>
                    <li>“Of course,” Buchanan cautions, “this model is so abstract that it is
                        not meant to provide detailed recommendations for public policy.”</li>
                    <li>that said, other findings: “the model reveals… that taxation will
                        tend to erode differences in wealth as long as the money is
                        redistributed to the society in a more or less equal way. After all,
                        taxation corresponds to the artificial addition of some extra links into
                        the network, along which wealth can flow from the rich toward the poor.”
                        <ul>
                            <li>“Taxation does not alter Pareto’s law, but the wealth will become
                                distributed somewhat more equitably, with the rich owning a smaller
                                fraction of the overall pie. Somewhat more surprisingly, the model
                                suggests that a like redistribution of wealth should result from any
                                economic measures aimed at boosting spending right across the economy.
                                Broad taxes on the sale of luxury items, for example, may even tend to
                                increase wealth disparities.”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>195: “In studying their model, however, Bouchard and Mézard
                discovered that if the investment irregularities grow sufficiently
                strong, they can completely overwhelm the natural diffusion of wealth
                provided by transactions.” i.e. a phase transition</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="beyond-coincidence">13. Beyond Coincidence</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>199: “what distinguishes a small-world network is not only that it
                has a low number of degrees of separation, but also that it remains
                highly clustered. We might say that the fabric of the network is densely
                weaved, so that any element remains comfortably and tightly enmeshed
                within a local web of connections. Consequently, the network overall can
                be viewed as a collection of clusters, within which the elements are
                intimately linked, as in a group of friends. A few ‘weak’ links between
                the clusters serve to keep the whole world small.”</li>
