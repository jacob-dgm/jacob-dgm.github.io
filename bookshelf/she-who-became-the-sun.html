			She Who Became the Sun – Shelley Parker-Chan
		</h2>

		<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> A recommendation of my friend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCekzHafDrKjyMc1Z29yYhzA" target="_blank">Grace
		Hendrickson-Jones</a>. I found the plot engaging from the beginning right
		through to the end. The fact that Zhu’s pronouns would change from
		chapter to chapter created confusion at times, but it made sense
		artistically. One could come away from the book thinking the moral is
		“do whatever is necessary to achieve your destiny; use the people around
		you until they are no longer useful, then discard them,” of which I was
		not a big fan. In any case, a well-crafted story.</p>
