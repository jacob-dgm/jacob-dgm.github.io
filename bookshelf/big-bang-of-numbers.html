			The Big Bang of Numbers: How to Build the Universe Using Only Math – Manil Suri
		</h2>
	
		<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> This is an odd book. The premise, of playing through a thought experiment to see whether the universe could be created using mathematics and nothing else, is an excuse to explore and explain various concepts within mathematics. It reads a bit like the script to a Vlog Brothers video (each of John Green’s videos is ostensibly addressed to Hank Green even as they’re also clearly pitched at the channel’s many non-Hank viewers), with Suri regularly making references to the pope, to whom he sent a perusal copy of the book in an (apparently unsuccessful) attempt to get him to write a review for the back cover. Didn’t learn much, but it was a fun read.</p>
		
		<p>(The notes below are not a summary of the book, but rather raw notes - whatever I thought, at the time, might be worth remembering.)</p>
